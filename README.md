# P.ovale assays
The code in this project accompanies an effort to develop novel real-time PCR assays for detection and species differentiation of *Plasmodium ovale* species. *Plasmodium ovale curtisi* and *Plasmodium ovale wallikeri*, which were formerly known as *P. ovale*, have potential differences in clinical symptomatology and latency, but few existing diagnostic assays have ability to detect and distinguish them. We developed and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of several new real-time PCR assays.
