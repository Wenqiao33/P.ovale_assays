# P.ovale_assays
The code in this project accompanies an analysis to evaluate novel reaL-time PCR assays for detection and species differentiate of Plasmodium ovale. P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri, which were formerly known as P. ovale, have potential differences in clinical symptomatology and latency, but few existing diagnostic assays have ability to detect and distinguish them. We developed and analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of the novel real-time PCR assays. All data are being made publicly available as well.
